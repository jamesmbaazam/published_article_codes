Some of the code was probably borrowed from FluTE (www.csquid.org/software),
also licensed under the GPL.

The synthetic population data for the model was derived from GRUMPv1
(http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw/) and Thai 2000 census data
as distributed by IPUMS (from https://international.ipums.org/international/) 
and supplied by Thailandâ€™s National Statistical Office. I assume it
is ok to distribute the synthetic population with these acknowledgments
unless told otherwise.
